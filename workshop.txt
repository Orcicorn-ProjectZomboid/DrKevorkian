title=Dr. Kevorkian's Assisted Suicide
description=In the 90s Dr. Kevorkian was a controversial figure who promoted the idea that "Dying is not a crime" and that terminally ill patients should have the right to die.  He was commonly referred to as "Dr. Death" and sparked a conversation about physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia.

description=With this mod I add in the ability to go out on your terms.  There are suicide drinks and pills that RAPIDLY accelerate the dying process and lets you choose when and how you're going to die.  No need to sit around suffering, starving and ultimately bleeding out.  Take a drink and within 15 minutes, you're gone.  Fortunate enough to find a suicide pill? It's now a painless and instantaneous death and it won't even zombify you. Death with dignity!

description=[h1]Lore Justification[/h1]
description=When the Knox event occurred many realized this was the end. They saw friends and family members suffering and dying on a daily basis.  Many who were previously opposed to physician assisted suicide changed their opinions and began to offer the services. So many in fact that "The Kevorkian Group" was formed by former physicians who now offered suicide assistance for those terminally ill with the Knox Virus.
description=
description=They began canvassing neighborhoods, working in hospitals and visiting pharmacies offering their services. They were easily identified by their black armbands and offered their services free of charge. Anyone and everyone could die a painless and prompt death if they so chose.
description=
description=Dr. Kevorkian himself visited Kentucky and offered his support to the group.  Eventually the Knox event took its toll and even the Kevorkian Group fell to it's deadly infection.  Now roaming the world aimlessly these Doctors often are carrying unused Concoctions and Pills.  Find one on your travels and a quick escape from this hellish nightmare can await you too.

description=[h1]But Why?[/h1]
description=On my friend's multiplayer server we found ourselves getting annoyed with having to find a group of zombies and die a long drawn out process.  At first it was just a simple suicide pill, but if you know anything about me I always take it too far. So here we are. A whole mod of suicidal doctors, pills, vhs tapes and lore justifying it all.
